Added version number to windows
Add version number to report description


Update URLs to the following:   https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forms/2-ksp2br/

Further Suggestions:

Put the installed files within their own folder within the KSP2 Installation folder.  (Like CKAN does)
Take away the player/reporters choice of where to put the bug packages. Just put them within a folder within the KSP2 Installation folder.
And perhaps a shortcut on the desktop for future use so they don't have to search for the KSP2 installation folder again or install from the download file again.
Then I have a few suggestions for the GUI which will help with the form if you are open to it. The players will still be potentially lost on a few more things that can be countered quite easily.
