Added version number to windows
Add version number to report description


DONE	Update URLs to the following:   https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forms/2-ksp2br/

Further Suggestions:

DONE	Put the installed files within their own folder within the KSP2 Installation folder.  (Like CKAN does)

DONE	Take away the player/reporters choice of where to put the bug packages. Just put them within a folder within the KSP2 Installation folder.

DONE	And perhaps a shortcut on the desktop for future use so they don't have to search for the KSP2 installation folder again or install from the download file again.


GUI: 
DONE	Take the Computer specs from Ksp2.log:
	And put onto the GUI for easier transfer to the form. Input boxes with them highlighted? 

Or autocopy with clicking in each box? Not sure the easiest way to implement it.



DONE	GUI: Add Button to open existing bug packages folder.
